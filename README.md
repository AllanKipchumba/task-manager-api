# task-manager-api

## About the project
The project is a rest API that authenticated users can use to create and track tasks. It is a simple API that allows users to add, change, and delete jobs.
It makes use of jwt tokens for authentication. 
Express and MongoDB were used to develop this project. For API testing, I relied heavily on Postman.
